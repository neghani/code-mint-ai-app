✅ Clean Code Rules (Compact Form)
Use short, clear names → getUser() not fetchUserDataFromDbLayer
One function = one responsibility
Keep functions ≤ 30 lines
Avoid deep nesting → max 2–3 levels
Prefer early returns over big if–else blocks
Remove dead code immediately
No magic numbers → use constants
Keep files focused → one module = one concern
Prefer pure functions where possible
Make side effects explicit
🧠 Token Optimization Rules for AI Coding
Use short identifiers but meaningful → cfg, ctx, req
Avoid verbose comments → comment only intent, not mechanics
Prefer patterns over prose → show example instead of explanation
Reuse helpers instead of re-implementing logic
Avoid long logs / debug strings
Use enums/constants instead of repeated literals
Prefer tables/maps over long condition chains
Return structured objects, not story text
Don’t restate obvious types in names → avoid userObjectData
Don't explain too much after the job
Don't create document unless asked 

✂️ Prompting Rules for Agent Code Generation
Specify output format → “return code only”
Define constraints in bullets
Give minimal context + exact goal
Provide skeletons instead of descriptions
Say what to avoid → “no comments”, “no tests”, etc.
Ask for diffs/patches instead of full files when updating
